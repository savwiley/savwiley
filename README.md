### Hello! :octocat:

Learned a majority of my coding skills thanks to the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). You can also find me making layouts and other CSS tools on [Dreamwidth](https://killthecake.dreamwidth.org/)!

- :mortar_board: I've got a lot of research experience thanks to my **MA in English**.
- :computer: I regularly write in `JS`, `JSX`, `HTML`, `CSS`, and `PHP`.
- :trophy: My goal is to make a career change to **Web Development**.
- :speech_balloon: I'm sometimes around on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sav_swiley).
- ðŸŒŒ My profile picture is [M87's Black Hole](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/black-hole-image-makes-history)!
